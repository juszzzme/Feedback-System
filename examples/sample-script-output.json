      "comfort_score": 8,
      "most_uncomfortable_line": "gross",
      "replacement_line": "challenging",
      "reasoning": "Reduced comfort due to potentially embarrassing language or tone. The phrase \"gross\" may make users self-conscious about their condition. A gentler, more affirming approach maintains the message while respecting user dignity."
    },
    "empathy": {
      "empathy_score": 8,
      "edit_1": "Replace a technical statement with empathetic framing. For example, change \"This product treats the condition\" to \"This product helps you manage your condition with confidence and comfort.\"",
      "edit_2": "Add validation: Instead of focusing only on product features, include \"Your experience matters, and we've designed this with your real-world needs in mind.\"",
      "reasoning": "These edits transform the script from transactional to relational. By acknowledging the user's emotional experience and emphasizing community and support, we create a deeper connection. Users feel understood rather than lectured to, which builds trust and loyalty."

      "alternative_punchline": "let's be real about it, itchy condition",
      "reasoning": "The phrase \"gross, itchy condition\" uses humor that may offend or demean users. In pharmaceutical contexts, humor should unite rather than divide, comfort rather than mock."
